## **Autochecker**

This project demonstrates a basic spelling correction system combined with next-word prediction using the Brown Corpus from NLTK.
It detects incorrect words in a user-input sentence, suggests corrections based on edit distance, and predicts the most probable next words using bigram and trigram language models.

🔤 Detects missing/incorrect words in user input

🧩 Finds the previous word context for incorrect words

📊 Builds bigram and trigram counts for word prediction

📈 Calculates next-word probabilities based on context

📝 Suggests corrections using Levenshtein (edit) distance

🔄 Replaces incorrect words with suggested corrections to form a corrected sentence

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
